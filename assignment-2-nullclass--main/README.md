# Task 2: Implement beam search decoding for an NMT model to improve translation quality.

## Overview
This task implements beam search decoding to improve the quality of translations provided by the NMT model. Beam search considers multiple possible sequences to provide the most probable translation.

## Model
- The model uses a transformer-based architecture.
- Beam search decoding is implemented to enhance translation accuracy.

## Data
- Data is the same as Task 1, with Spanish-English translation pairs.

## Files
- `task2.ipynb`: Contains the transformer model and beam search implementation.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_name>
